 p1 is an instance of PersonWithJob and p2 is an instance of Person 
 The equals method is overridden in both the classes. 
  In the first comparison p1.equals(p2). 
  ->we compare the name and salary of both the object and only if both fields match then the answer should return true.
    in this case p1 and p2 have the same name
    but p1 has a salary of 30.000 and p2 doesn't have a salary,so the salary field doesn't match and we get false.
    
 In the second comparison p2.equals(p1)
  -> here we compare only the name field because p1 has only 1 field to compare.
  so the if both the objects name are the same then answer returns true.
  in this case both objects have the name Joe,so answer is true.
